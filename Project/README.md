# üöó Real-Time Dynamic Pricing System for Smart Parking




## üìù Project Overview

This project implements a real-time dynamic pricing system for smart parking management using data streaming with Pathway and visualizations via Bokeh and Panel. It dynamically adjusts parking prices based on real-time data such as occupancy, traffic, queue length, and special events to maximize efficiency and revenue.

We simulate data streaming from historical records and plot real-time pricing graphs for each parking lot using Bokeh-powered interactive dashboards.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture & Workflow Explanation

1. Data Ingestion
We read a CSV file (dataset.csv) simulating historical parking data.

Pathway reads it in streaming mode, processing records at fixed intervals (autocommit_duration_ms=500).

2. Real-Time Processing (Model 2)
A custom UDF (compute_dynamic_price) computes the parking price based on:

Occupancy rate

Queue length

Traffic conditions

Vehicle type

Special event flag

This price is continuously calculated and updated as new rows arrive.

3. Real-Time Visualization
We use Pathway's .plot() method to bind real-time data to a custom Bokeh chart.

Panel serves this plot as an interactive live dashboard.
